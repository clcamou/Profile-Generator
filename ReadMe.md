# Profile Generator

## Overview
    This is a node app that takes the user input github username and color, and generates an html and a PDF based on the user input.

## How It Works 
    1. This app takes input from the client via inquirer
    2. It then uses that imput to make an axios call
    3. The axios call generates an html
    4. The html is then converted to a pdf
